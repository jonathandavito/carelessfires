			<p>Rebranding happens for a lot of reasons - expansion of business, acquiring a new company, or maybe realigning to pivot in the market. But whatever the reason, it’s a collaborative effort, sometimes across multiple sectors of the business to bring the new brand to life under a new banner. At the time my responsibility was to translate the new company logo my senior designer was creating and expanding it to the UI of 3 websites. The result was a cohesive UI design system that brought the 3 brands under one roof and boosted engagement and sales because of it. </p>

			<p>Sadly, my senior designer at the time left the company due to personal reasons in the middle of these projects. We had the new branding completed, but this was a situation where I was filling big shoes in a short amount of time. We didn’t have the budget the fill the position so I had to grow to fill the gaps for our already small team. I started with tackling the UI system first and planning out how to build each of these sites on Wordpress with a custom theme that could be extended across all of them.</p>

			<p>Once I had the groundwork laid down on the first site completed, extending our codebase was a fairly simple process. This gave me room to meet with marketing, sales, and even R&D towards the end of the project, to figure out how extend the new design language to things like packaging to give a new face the new products we would be launching. It was cool to design packaging that would be visible in Home Depot.</p>

			<p>Overall, these projects took about a year in between the teams day-to-day tasks and created new sales funnels that weren't there before. The new branding was a hit among customers new and old and paired with our SEO strategies and an <a href="/projects/ecommerce-design.html">updated e-commerce site</a> the company successfully launched its new line of smart devices.</p>
