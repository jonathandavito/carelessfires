			<p>My involvement with marketing departments tend to be a slow burn. An email design here, a functional graphic there, and then working up to a helping with a rebrand (more of a refresh in this case). Because of my broad skillset I tend to reverberate between software development and marketing and when the teams are small enough, I try to act as a bridge. The UI designers or developers aren't always privy to how to use branding standards if marketing is the department that creates those standards. Keeping the UI on brand becomes a shot in the dark if you don't have a <a href="../projects/design-system.html">system</a> to guide you and you end up with a <span class="rainbow">rainbow</span> of colors that are used in marketing collateral and the UI. Bringing order to both was a task I took on to not only make this easier to maintain and produce, but make a more unified experience for the customer.</p>
