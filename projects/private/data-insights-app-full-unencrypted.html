			<p>Acquiring a startup and their tech in 2020 is already a bold move. Rebuilding it from scratch in less than a year is bolder. The original tool had great value to its customers but was borderline unusable to anyone who didn‚Äòt already live and breath <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_demand_management" target="_blank">energy demand management</a>. Being built with a third-party front-end that seemed boundless in its capabilities resulted in two things ‚Äì‚Äì high-cost customer training and endless feature requests with the ability to add new data points at will. The perceived value lead to something that became harder to maintain and the third-party front-end membership alone added a massive annual cost.</p>

				<div class="aside-text"><p class="sm-text">Et voil√†! The finished product consisted of accessible sidebar controls that were collapsible for a more focused experience when looking at large sets of data. The original tool had lots of visuals that made it slow (1 - 5min load times between pages) and often created confusion and doubt when analyzing datasets. While I don't have any screenshots of the decommissioned tool, <a href="https://www.yellowfinbi.com">Yellowfin</a> was the third party software it was built on.</p></div>

				<div class="aside-text"><p class="sm-text">And because <span class="rainbow">all of our users in testing</span> expressed that data visualizations in the previous tool ‚Äúadded no value‚Äù, we put them on a second tab. That way the tabular data they came for is front and center while still having a relevant data visualization to interact with and export if they needed it for creating their own reports, presentations, or other offline needs.</p></div>

				<div class="aside-text"><p class="sm-text">We made use of a modal design to expand on details of particular data points. The product in its entirety consisted of 8 dashboards worth of data portals. It essentially allowed utilities and solution providers (who pitch to utilities) across the US and Canada to to see how their programs stack against each other with a great level of detail and granularity.</p></div>

We had plans on the roadmap to expand on it in post-launch maintenance sprints and make it standard across all of our products.</p></div>

			<p>We spent about 2 months gathering requirements, learning about the tool, and documenting its intricacies. We asked ourselves how we might make the tool more performant and friendly to new customers while providing the same value, depth, and power of its predecessor. Initially slated for a tentative year long timeline for the project, our timeline get‚Äôs cut almost in half 4 months in, and then the pandemic happens.</p>

			<p>We held weekly meetings with our stakeholders to keep everyone involved accountable and on-pace. It was a balancing act of breaking down our past and present assumptions of the tool with <span class="rainbow">several rounds of user interviews</span> and relying on our stakeholders‚Äô deep domain knowledge as a guide. We would design a feature take it to stakeholders for approval and test it with users to iterate effectively. The Adobe XD file I ended up with was one of the largest I've worked on ‚Äì‚Äì <span class="rainbow">behold</span>.</p>

			<p>Our wireframes were kept low-fidelity for clarity and focused on rapidly testing to iterate quickly. Building the front-end for the application was incredibly simple utilizing R Shiny (and having a <a href="https://github.com/leonawicz" target="_blank">kick-ass R developer on our team</a>) that allowed us to extend the front-end with very little custom code. With the company‚Äôs brand refresh in tow ‚Äì‚Äì <a href="../projects/marketing-design.html">more on that later</a> ‚Äì‚Äì I had the opportunity to create some little logos for each dashboard of the product to make the rebuild more impactful.</p>

					<p class="sm-text">The previous tool had all the dashboard names across the top in a mile-long tab menu scrolling left-to-right. To improve this experience we created a simple fly-out menu to easily switch between dashboards and tucked the link for it underneath the dashboard title so it would be familiar to existing customers. Keeping things familiar while providing a new design paradigm was a difficult challenge, but our users in testing found it to be easier to navigate regardless of previously engrained patterns.</p>

			<p>Being granted the budget to user test at different stages throughout the rebuild allowed us to make meaningful enhancements. We were able to identify successful design patterns to reuse and technical bugs to address. The interview process was structured around a <span class="rainbow">diverse groups of participants with different experience levels</span> with the previous tool. The data collected was synthesized into feature updates and bug lists.</p>
