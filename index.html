      <div class="animation-element slide-left">
        <h3>Product design</h3>
        <p class="lg-text">
          Well-built products are ones that are able to build a healthy relationship between the business and the
          consumer. Ethics should be the grounding point of product design, but we can easily observe how striving to
          consistently profit off of users is a poor ethical practice and an even poorer business strategy. We meet
          users where they're at to identify and understand their needs to come up with a sustainable solution for both
          them and the business. I do this by working closely with business stakeholders, product management, user
          research, customer service,
          engineering teams, and when possible, customers, to create the best experience possible. Make well and take
          care.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="animation-element slide-right">
        <h3>Design systems</h3>
        <p class="lg-text">
          Systems can only be measured by what they enable. In product design, software that can scale well are ones
          that
          can iterate and innovate
          unencumbered by a bespoke design process. That’s not to say bespoke
          design doesn’t have its place in tasks like branding, but design
          systems enable consistency when producing or maintaining a product.
          But this isn't a silver bullet for scalability or really any fundamental issues we see today in product
          design; it's just another tool for creating consistency, trust, and most importantly, equity. What good is a
          system if doesn't enable the inclusion of all users. Accessiblity of your product must be thought of at the
          conception of new features, not after. Design systems enable designers to think through those challenges in a
          consistent manner so we don't leave people out – intentionally or not.

        <h3>Bridging the gap</h3>
        <p class="lg-text">
          I've worn many hats in my career and front-end engineer was one of them. Designing and developing
          high-fidelity prototypes using HTML, CSS,
          and JavaScript allow me to present functional prototypes and ship
          production-level code. Being multidisciplinary allows me make
          better design decisions, explore the cost of ideas quickly, and work
          more effectively with engineers. I like to serve as the bridge
          between business &amp; design needs and development feasibility. I have experience with everything from CSS to
          modern JS and even some PHP, but even though I develop front-end experiences anymore, I still keep up-to-date
          with my knowledge on software engineer (and use this website as practice).

        If you made it this far – <span class="rainbow">✨thanks✨</span> – I'm happy that you find my little corner of
        the
        internet interesting. Feel free to get in touch with me via any of the links below. I'm generally will take to
        respond, if I do, because I want to foster an expectation of respect for each other's time and space. LinkedIn
        is good to get your foot in the door to talk shop, but if you really wanna get into something, long form, send
        me an email. If it's not spam, I <em>will</em> respond.
