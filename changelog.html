        <h2 class="animation-element slide-right">What organizations hire me to do</h2>
        <div class="animation-element slide-left">
          <h3>Product design</h3>
          <p class="lg-text">
            Well-built products are ones that focus on the business and user
            needs and should be measured by what they enable. By conducting user
            research, usability testing, and discovery interviews we can
            identify and understand problems to then iterate over solutions.
            This allows us to validate our assumptions with users or allow us to
            observe unexpected behavior to pivot our approach. I like to work
            closely with stakeholders, product management, design, and
            engineering teams to create the best experience possible.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="animation-element slide-right">
          <h3>Design systems</h3>
          <p class="lg-text">
            Products that scale well are ones that can iterate and innovate
            unencumbered by a bespoke design process. That’s not to say bespoke
            design doesn’t have its place in tasks like branding, but design
            systems enable consistency when producing or maintaining a product.
            Everything from creating branding standards to design patterns to
            typography, I thoroughly enjoy building visual guidelines for
            digital products that increase efficiency and scalability.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="animation-element slide-left">
          <h3>Front-end development</h3>
          <p class="lg-text">
            Designing and developing high-fidelity prototypes using HTML, CSS,
            and JavaScript allow me to present functional prototypes and ship
            production-level code. Being a multidisciplinary allows me make
            better design decisions, explore the cost of ideas quickly, and work
            more effectively with developers. I like to serve as the bridge
            between business &amp; design needs and development feasibility. I
            have experience building front-end architecture that use frameworks
            like Sass, jQuery, and React.js, but I also have some PHP experience
            working with open-source content management systems like Drupal and
            Wordpress.
